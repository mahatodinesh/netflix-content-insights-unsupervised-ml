# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering | Unsupervised Machine Learning Project

This project leverages **Unsupervised Machine Learning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover valuable insights from the Netflix content dataset. The goal is to assist Netflix in optimizing content management, enhancing user experience, and driving strategic business decisions.

---

##  Project Overview

- **Type**: Unsupervised Machine Learning
- **Domain**: Entertainment / Streaming
- **Objective**: Cluster Netflix content to identify trends, improve recommendations, and inform business strategy.

---

##  Business Impact

###  Positive Impact:

- Optimized content production and planning using genre and country-based insights.
- Automated classification and recommendation systems using ML clustering.
- Improved personalization via content-based recommendation models.
- Strategic focus shift identified: rise of TV Shows over Movies.
- Localization opportunities revealed via country-wise content concentration.

###  Caution Points (Potential Negative Impact):

- Over-reliance on specific regions (e.g., US, India) may limit global expansion.
- Imbalance in content diversity may reduce viewer engagement over time.

---

##  Business Recommendations

-  Use ML to automate content tagging and classification.
-  Optimize content mix for broader audience reach.
-  Expand globally with regional strategies and localized content.
-  Improve personalization using clustering-based recommender systems.

---

##  Techniques Used

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Time, country, and content-type trends.
-  **TF-IDF Vectorization**: For textual data (descriptions, genres).
-  **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar content.
-  **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommendation system.
-  **Random Forest Classifier**: To predict content type (Movie vs TV Show).
-  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: For model optimization.
-  **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

---

##  Key Insights

-  TV Shows have grown significantly since 2016 — indicating a strategic shift.
-  Most content is concentrated in the US and India — untapped global markets remain.
-  Clustering grouped similar content genres and themes effectively.
-  Random Forest model accurately classified content type with high performance.

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Unsupervised ML and EDA can support:

- Strategic content planning
- Regional expansion
- Automated classification
- User personalization

With data-driven insights, Netflix can continue growing with confidence while maintaining user satisfaction and content diversity.
